# Youtube-Chat-in-Fullscreen
Show Youtube live chat when in full screen mode

### Know Issues

- Author name can not stick to one line if it is little bit long
- Cannot show emoji, this can be serious, since if the first character is emoji, the comment will become empty
- Can have performance issue, video suffered from frame drop when chat overlay appear (reason unknown, maybe related to render layer)
- When replay the live chat, the time to next chat request is unknow
