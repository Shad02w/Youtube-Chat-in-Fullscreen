# Youtube-Chat-in-Fullscreen
Show Youtube live chat when in full screen mode

### Know Issues

- Can have performance issue, video suffered from frame drop when chat overlay appear (reason unknown, maybe related to render layer)
- Moving and resizing the chat box can be laggy on replay live page.
- Green screen when fresh the youtube page with chat overlay shown

### TODO

- [x] Turn on/off the chat list overlay directly temporarily without going to options page
- [ ] Show membership ticker and super chat
- [ ] Chat list remain unchanged when user exit autoscroll mode
